# CovidARVisualizer

Inspiration
The inspiration of this project was to improve the general understanding of the users with the growth of COVID-19 by location and time. We wanted to maximize this project that could be applicable to any data over a course of time and geography. Moreover, to we also wanted to maximize accessibility for users that don't regularly look at COVID-19 data.

What it does
It uses augmented reality to create a visually appealing user interface to understand the evolution of cases in every state in the United States.

How we built it
Accessed Google Cloud public data to access the cumulative cases and deaths for every day since the appearance of a case. Used Unity and C# to access Google Cloud BigQuery and create a json file / query.

Challenges we ran into
Accessing Google public data and authenticating. Accessing outside public libraries outside of Unity was a challenge.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
Learning new languages like BigQuery and C#.

What we learned
Learning how to access public data using Google Platform. Also using Unity and BigQuery in ways that we had never used before.

What's next for Covid-19 Augmented Reality Visualizer
Be able to make it more internationally applicable and visual for future growth or decay in cases and deaths. By looking at projections, this can also maximize how professionals can understand their growth and/or decay on a presentation level.
